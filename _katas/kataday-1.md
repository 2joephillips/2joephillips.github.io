## Set-up
This is supposed to be fun. Have fun with it.

### Kata &#8212; *Two letter number combinations*

Create a listing of all the two character combinations that exist with using only letters and numbers. {i.e. 11, 1A, A1, AA}
No special characters.

## My Thoughts
I used C#.

I could have made this harder by requiring myself to use any other language {i.e. PHP, JavaScript}. The premise for this was that I actually had to create this listing for a project, so it made sense for my first Kata. The code for solving this was actually straight forward. Of course, this was not a mind blowing Kata. Simple and Easy. Something to get the brain started. Have to crawl before you can walk&#8230;. Running is later!
