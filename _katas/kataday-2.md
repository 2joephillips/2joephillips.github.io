## Set-up
There are **five simple Kata's and you have 25 minutes to complete them all**. So, read them over, and start your timer.

### Kata 1 &#8212; *Apply Surname to Given First Names*
Write a program that asks for the user&#8217;s name and then writes that name to the monitor with either &#8220;Ms.&#8221; or &#8220;Mr.&#8221; in front, depending if the name is for a female or male. List of names below:

<table class="table">
   <thead>
     <tr>
       <th>Female Names</th>
       <th>Male Names</th>
     </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
     <tr>
       <td>Belle</td>
       <td>Beast</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Anna</td>
       <td>Kristoff</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Jack</td>
       <td>Sally</td>
     </tr>
   </tbody>
 </table>


### Kata 2 &#8212; *Name Echo*  
Write a program that asks for user&#8217;s name (First Last) and then writes it back with the first name as entered, and the second name all in capital letters.

### Kata 3 &#8212; *Convert String to a Letter per Line*
Write a program where the user enters a string, and the program writes it to the monitor/console with one character per line.

### Kata 4 &#8212; *Area of a Circle*
Write a program that calculates the area of a circle from its radius. The radius will be an integer read in from the keyboard.

### Kata 5 &#8212; *Change Counter*
Write a program that reads in a number of pennies. The program will write out the number of dollars and cents.


## My Thoughts
Overall, this was a great exercise, it really forced me to think on my feet. While the exercises were easy, they each had their little nuances. I suggest do these Katas with one or more programmers. Not as a race, but to see what variances exists.  For example, one programmer was able to answer Exercise 5 in **ONE LINE**! It took me several more.

Below are the differences between me and a co-worker. This was based on our thought process. I was going for quick … Array, For Each, set surname, and print to console.log(). Co-worker was thinking about pulling from a “dictionary” so he created a separate method. Interesting differences based on such a simple process. We both completed the exercise, but essentially different processes.
