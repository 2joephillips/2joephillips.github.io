I ran across this story. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/09/29/how-this-company-is-trying-to-eradicate-email/">How This Company Is Trying To Eradicate Email</a>.
It got me thinking about *zeroing out our inboxes and reducing time spent on email.
<p/>
<p>
  Could you imagine, clearing out your inbox daily like the mailbox in your driveway!?! Earning some special Zero Badge.
<p>
<p>
  We can all agree with this statement from the article….
</p>

<blockquote>
  … 10 percent of the 200 messages … received on an average day were useful,
    and that 18 percent were spam. Managers spent between five and 20 hours a week reading and writing emails.
</blockquote>

  In saying all this, I wanted to share how I have implemented <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero">Merlin Mann’s Inbox Zero</a>
  over the last year by following these simple rules:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/03/14/delete/"><b>Delete it</b></a>! Sometimes
    this is the correct step… Let it go, that is what that link on the internet said.</li>
  <li><b>Delegate/Forward it</b> if it's not your area, get it to the right person.</li>
  <li><b>Do it</b> Two Minute Rule. If you can do it quickly. Do it. Quick WIN!</li>
  <li>
    <b>Date/Time it</b> Set up a time to do it.
    <ol>
      <li>
        To accomplish this I use a combination of Smart Search Folders, Categories, and Follow-ups.
      </li>
      <li>
        If someone wants, I will be glad to show how I do this… or this link provides some detail :
        <a href="http://hackerspace.kinja.com/how-i-get-to-zero-inbox-in-outlook-1524583084">How I Get to Inbox Zero in Outlook</a>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, <b>archive the finished product</b>. Not the email trail.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>By doing this, I have limited the time I use to monitor email and be more organized within the work day.</p>
