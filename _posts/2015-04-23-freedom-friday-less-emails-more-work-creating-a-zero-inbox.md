I ran across this story. [How This Company Is Trying To Eradicate Email][1] It got me thinking about *zeroing out our inboxes and reducing time spent on email*. Could you imagine, clearing out your inbox daily like home mailboxes!?!

We can all agree with this statement from the article….

> “… 10 percent of the 200 messages … received on an average day were useful, and that 18 percent were spam. Managers spent between five and 20 hours a week reading and writing emails.”

In saying all this, I wanted to share how I have implemented Merlin Mann’s [Inbox Zero][2] over the last year by following these simple rules:

  1. **[Delete it][3] ** – yes, sometimes this is the correct step… Let it go, that is what that link on the internet said. J
  2. **Delegate/Forward it ** – if it’s not your area, get it to the right person.
  3. **Do it** – Two – Minute Rule. If you can do it quickly. Do it. Quick WIN!
  4. **Date/Time it** – Set up a time to do it. 
      1. To accomplish this I use a combination of Smart Search Folders, Categories, and Follow-ups.
  5. Finally, **archive the finished product**… Not the email trail.

By doing this, I have limited the time I use to monitor email and be more organized within the work day.
