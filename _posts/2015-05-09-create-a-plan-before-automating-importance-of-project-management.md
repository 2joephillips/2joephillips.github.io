<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">Too many times, I see areas or teams wanting to reduce the time creating a widget or developing a single touch solution for a very manual data entry. But, the downside is, is the first thing they want to do is <i>implement</i> the automation before they understand the full process as been vetted out. </span></span></span>

<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">To be efficient, we need to initiate a project, plan and design a process, execute it, monitor, and control (repeat when necessary), and close the project. This will lead to creating more widgets, reduce humane resources, and avoid making a million widgets wrong with automation. The focus needs to be put on understanding how a widget is first created without systems interaction.</span></span></span>
