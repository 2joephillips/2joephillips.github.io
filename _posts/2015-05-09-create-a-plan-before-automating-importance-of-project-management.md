Too many times, I see areas or teams wanting to reduce the time creating a widget or developing a single touch solution for a very manual data entry. But, the downside is, is the first thing they want to do is *implement* the automation before they understand the full process as been vetted out.

To be efficient, we need to initiate a project, plan and design a process, execute it, monitor, and control (repeat when necessary), and close the project. This will lead to creating more widgets, reduce humane resources, and avoid making a million widgets wrong with automation. The focus needs to be put on understanding how a widget is first created without systems interaction.

In all I think we need more access to [Project Management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management) skills. Obtaining [Six Sigma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_sigma)  and [PMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Professional) certifications is not for everyone, but I do believe teaching these skills is beneficial to any area or company. 

There are so many, below are two that I have used over the years.

[Project Manage StackExchange](http://pm.stackexchange.com/) is a question and answer site for project managers. It&#8217;s 100% free, no registration required.

[*The Mythical Man-Month*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)  is a book on software engineering and project management by [Fred Brooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks)
