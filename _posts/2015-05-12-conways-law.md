I have been doing a lot of reading lately, and there are several concepts that I have enjoyed learning. I will share these ideas at random, so I hope you enjoy.

Conway’s Law. The following link is an [article on Conway’s Law][1] and the source for most of this post.

The [Conway’s Law][2] comes from Melvin Conway, and it states:

**Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization&#8217;s communication structure.**

Since I am a visual person, the [Manu Cornet’s visual interpretation][3] of this law helps me better understand how this plays out in some of the top companies.

I like the multiple comparisons, but Google and Apple drive home the concept, I think.

For example, both companies sell digital content, I.e. music, movies, games, but there sales ‘system’ is inherently connected to their communication structure. Apple has been and hopefully always known for their singular vision. This radiated from Steve Jobs and continues with Tim Cook that first and foremost Apple was a software company. All sales of digital content are made to promote the sale of Hardware. The purchase of digital content, only useable on Apple hardware, from ITunes creates a circular effect that draws you into buying/upgrading you Apple devices. Hence, there System always radiates from a central location.

For Google, selling digital content is a part of the hierarchy of items that they sell to gain a profit. There communication method is not centrally located, but with more of web of areas overlapping. This creates a radiating effect as communication grows additional overlap and reconnecting is required. They are multiple visions. Saling digital Media is only one part of the greater scheme.

Interesting! Right! So, with this Law what is  your companies communication model, and how does it play into your systems design?
