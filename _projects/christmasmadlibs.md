This site was a simple idea for a way to have fun during the Christmas Holidays. It builds on the fun of a simple Mad Lib. There are three Christmas options to chose from.
The user selects, then fills in the answers, and recieves the classic Christmas stories with a slight twist. 

The fun about this project is that I built it from idea to release in a couple hours using Angular and hosting on Heroku. If you would like to check it out
