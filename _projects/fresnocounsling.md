With 20 impressive years in therapy, [Fonda Hart](http://www.fresnocounseling.com/background/){:target="_blank"}, had a website that wasnâ€™t quite as impressive as her experience. Not only was the site not optimized for mobile viewing, much of the content was hidden in lengthy text, making it very difficult to read and navigate.

I partnered with [Wingspan Marketing](http://www.wingspanmarketing.com/){:target="_blank"} to create a new, mobile responsive website that was easy to navigate and showcased her experience. The clean navigation menus and fresh messaging made browsing her website a pleasure; the new BrainPaint section allowed her to showcase this service and give details on the results of BrainPaint.
