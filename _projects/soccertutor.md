When [TK Stanford](http://www.thesoccertutor.com/about-me/){:target="_blank"} had a vision for creating an online [subscription service to sell instructional videos](http://www.thesoccertutor.com/register/){:target="_blank"}, I was glad to parter with him and [Wingspan Marketing](http://www.wingspanmarketing.com/){:target="_blank"} to help achieve his goal.

For this project, his ideas and business model were used to develop a plan that delivered a custom mobile responsive website that showcased his lesson plans. The site was tailored to meet his needs allowing him to quickly set price for subscriptions, upload new video tutorials, and provided security from illegal access.
