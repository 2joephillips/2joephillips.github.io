<h2>About Me</h2>

<h4>I am passionate about Helping, Creating, and Developing new ways to communicate.</h4>
<p>My first computer experience was in 3rd Grade, I was using a green screen machine to learn my math skills. The teacher was just as new to using a computer as we were. Since that first day, I saw the need to help bridge the gap. to help people learn to love and enjoy technology.</p>
<p>I love helping people create a site for telling their story and building your company's online presence or store front.</p>
<p>With experience in developing solutions for problems, I bring a background of experiences that helps me listen to the issue and provide a plan for executing a solution. This could be site development, content creation, or managing social media</p>
