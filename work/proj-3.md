With 10 year experience in selling homes in Buford, GA, I was able to help [HillWood Home Team](http://hillwoodhometeam.com/) refresh their brand with new listings presentations and updating their website to be mobile responsive and incorporate MLS search.  Doing all this to highlight the services they provide to buyers and sellers.

For the site, I was able to leverage [WebsiteBox's](https://www.websitebox.com/) MLS search and hosting that only cost a one time fee of $99.00. This savings allowed them to redirect funds for use in other marketing areas.

To better engage potential clients, a complete redesign of their listings presentation was made. The new design helped to convey the services that are provided by the HillWood Home Team. As well as modernized the overall look and feel of company.
