title: HSFCGA - Bark And Boogie Ball
---

The Humane Society of Forsyth County needed a way to manage their annual [Bark & Boogie Ball](http://bbb.forsythpets.org/). They needed a website that could manage the tracking of attendees, auction items, and manage the bidding process.

The site was developed using Laravel back-end with AngularJs Front-end and can be used free by pulling from [GitHub](https://github.com/2joephillips/BarkAndBoogieBallv2).

#### Check-Out
Another key functionality was that Auction Items needed to be assigned to Attendees, and Attendees be able to check-out and record payment for items own.
